# Interactive Coding

This folder houses all [F# Interactive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/) scripts.

This is a good place to explore concepts and ideas and to do little experiments to learn about internals of structures and operations.

There is a file `setup_fsi.fsx` that properly sets up all the boilerplate, so you can just create a new `.fsx` and get started without any obstacle.
